# Why am I doing this?

Firstly, apparently I'm a glutton for punishment but mostly because I've been a software developer for a long time and not once have I seen a language designed for the one thing I spend most of my time doing. Creating software for people to use that is safe. Why do we settle for shoe horned languages and frameworks or the argument of _"just do it natively for each platform?"_

I want a single language that compiles to native binaries that target each platform, not a web view, not JavaScript, not owned or deeply funded/owned by sponsorship by a large corporation but a single, source of truth language that allows anyone to build **great** software with no matter what needs to get done.

We; as the community have a right and an obligation to ensure the safety and ownership of our software chains and so, I encourage you to fork it, learn it, improve it and submit PRs and together we create a language that we own, control and distribute across platforms without any privately owned company in any form of control.

>_Actively; and consciously, design away mechanisms designed to screw anyone else over._

## What am I actually trying to do here?

having spent a large amount of my career across the entire spectrum of software development I've been privvy to a whole range of problems with coding. Specifically the cross platform-ness of any given technology and it's always been a gripe of mine that there wasn't actually a native way to do anything across platforms that didn't involve knowing how to write safe C++ or using enormous DSLs like Qt with it's own compilation and licensing problems.


## Goals of the Software
  * Design a language:
	* that's easy to understand, test and deploy cross-platform
	* that's safe to use
	  * Memory safe
	  * Type safe
	  * Intellectual Property safe.
	* that enforces useful testing
	* that enforces the best accessibility standards possible
	* has built in tooling for
	  * Package management
	  * Profiling and debugging with llvm
	  * Testing with coverage
	  * Supply chain management
	  * Opsec management
	  * Ci/cd integration
* Financial Involvement
  * There is no financial involvement or investment other than contributor's time at this time, however if an entity wants to invest in the future development we can talk about ethics and transparency of said investment which will be made public and any and all transactions made public to and from whatever entity/charity may be in control of the language.
* Company Goals
  * There is no company or non-profit/charity in control of elp at the moment but I have considered filing for a non-profit status in the future to make any form of investment a greater good investment.
* Do the goals of the project line up with the goals of the contributors / users?
  * I strongly believe that developers across the world are unknowingly supporting and encouraging large corporations to privatise large parts of their income methods and that an open platform and language to enable a better self-investment.
